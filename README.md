# hello-world
It's a start

I'm an 18-year old programmer with a 30-year headstart. For me, it's fun to have fun again. I've spent decades writing ads and now I'm teaching myself to write code. 

I bought the Jon Duckett books HTML & CSS and Javascript & JQuery which were my start. I found in them what I'd been searching for which was a simple "this makes this" visualization of the workings behind websites. 

Now I'm loving 'Eloquent JavaScript' because it illuminates protocol with refreshing perspective. 

I'm inspired by mentors including @bradfrost and @lydiahallie and I'll always give back because they do it so generously.
